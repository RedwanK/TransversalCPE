# WebView Leaflet Map Into Angular 8

## Running the demo

After loading, the map is rendered at the center coordinates injected into the application.  The zoom level is currently hardcoded along with some map marker coordinates.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
